### Session
**Dead Trackers Tell No Tales: Understanding and blocking third-party
tracking and browser fingerprinting**

<blockquote>
Today, the web is evolving at an amazing pace with a richer, more personal and more interactive user experience.
Nevertheless, modern browser technologies, which provide the beauty and power of the web, also provide a darker side,
a rich ecosystem of exploitable data that can be used to track users on the web.
<br>
In this session, participants will learn about third-party tracking and more specifically about browser fingerprinting.
What is it? How does it work? What can we do to stop it? What is Mozilla currently cooking inside Firefox to mitigate
fingerprinting? All of these questions will be covered and more. Third-party tracking is a reality and it is time to
put control back in users' hands.

### What
I'll start the session by detailing what is online tracking and how it works with a heavy focus on cookies.
Then, I'll get into what can be installed or configured in your browser to protect your online activities from trackers.
I'll continue by explaining what is browser fingerprinting and how it works.
Finally, I'll finish by explaining the different tools (already included or coming) in Firefox to protect
users against online tracking.
Questions and discussions will be very welcome during this session so that each participant can get a
better understanding of the current online tracking ecosystem.


See you in London!
