title: End of GSoC and Fingerprint Central beta!
---

An incredible summer has come and passed and the Google Summer of Code 2016 is over! 
After several weeks of designing and developing features to make my GSoC proposal a reality, Fingerprint Central is finally live! You can try the beta [HERE](https://fpcentral.irisa.fr/)! The complete source code with the list of technologies can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/plaperdr/fp-central).

During the bonding period, I discussed with my mentor to decide which technology we should use for the project. We ended up choosing Flask for the server and MongoDB for the database. It proved quickly to be a really good choice for me as it provided me with all the necessary tools to make the project as I envisioned it from the start: easy to use and to maintain. With the power of a NoSQL database, I'm able  to efficiently add new tests in the fingerprinting test suite on FP Central. With the tag system I added, I can also classify with ease any fingerprints by adding a few lines of code. Finally, thanks to great JavaScript libraries, I've added tools for researchers and developers to look into the data that matter to them by giving them the choice to select the attributes and the fingerprints they want to study. 

For Fingerprint Central, the official end of the GSoC coding period truly marks the beginning of the adventure! Now, the site is fully ready to welcome visitors and the collected data will hopefully provide developers with enough insight to improve the Tor browser fingerprinting defenses. The next chapter of Fingerprint Central will start to write itself in the next few weeks when the site will be launched in a more official manner. In the meantime, I'll make sure to squash the last remaining bugs to make the experience as smooth as possible for users.
To finish this post, I would like to personally thank Georg Koppen, my mentor from the Tor organization for his guidance and advice during the coding period. He helped me steer the project in the right direction and introduced me to this wonderful Tor community.
