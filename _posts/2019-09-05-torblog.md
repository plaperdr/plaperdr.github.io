I'm excited to finally share that my post for the Tor blog is up! In it, I give a quick introduction to browser fingerprinting and I talk about what the Tor Browser is doing to fight against it. 
You can find the post <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/browser-fingerprinting-introduction-and-challenges-ahead" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
