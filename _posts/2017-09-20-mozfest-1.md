### Session
**Dead Trackers Tell No Tales: Understanding and blocking third-party
tracking and browser fingerprinting**

<blockquote>
Today, the web is evolving at an amazing pace with a richer, more personal and more interactive user experience.
Nevertheless, modern browser technologies, which provide the beauty and power of the web, also provide a darker side,
a rich ecosystem of exploitable data that can be used to track users on the web.
<br>
In this session, participants will learn about third-party tracking and more specifically about browser fingerprinting.
What is it? How does it work? What can we do to stop it? What is Mozilla currently cooking inside Firefox to mitigate
fingerprinting? All of these questions will be covered and more. Third-party tracking is a reality and it is time to
put control back in users' hands.
