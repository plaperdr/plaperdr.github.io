On **March 15th**, I'll participate in the second edition of the Cryptoparty organised at the INSA de Rennes. Just as I did last year, I'll host a small workshop on browser fingerprinting to inform users of the dangers of tracking on the Internet and to explain what they can do to protect themselves. You can find more information and register for this event [HERE](http://biblio.insa-rennes.fr/crypto).
