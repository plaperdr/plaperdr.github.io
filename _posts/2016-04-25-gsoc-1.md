title: Participation in the 2016 Google Summer of Code!
---

I'm really excited to announce that my proposal to build a AmIUnique-like website for the Tor organisation has been accepted as part of the GSoC 2016! I'm really glad to have this opportunity to help the Tor community reinforce the fingerprinting defenses of the Tor browser.

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
![]({{ "/blog/images/gsoc.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }} "GSoC logo")
</div>

You can find my complete proposal [here](assets/documents/proposal-gsoc16.pdf) (the Torprinter name will be changed) and the page of the project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5574889654190080). I will officialy start coding at the end of May so keep an eye on this blog for reports on my progress. This summer is surely going to be a lot of fun!
