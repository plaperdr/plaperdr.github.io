On **December 8th**, I'll be in Nancy to talk about [AmIUnique and browser fingerprinting](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/nancy/innovation/rii-2016/demos/amiunique). I'll demo Blink for anyone who is interested to know more about the defense we are developping. You can find more information on the meeting [HERE](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/nancy/innovation/rii-2016/presentation) (you can register [HERE](http://forms.loria.fr/inscription-a-la-rencontre-inria-industrie/), it is free).
