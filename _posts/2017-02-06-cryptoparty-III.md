On **March 4th**, as part of the third edition of the Cryptoparty in Rennes,  I'll be hosting a workshop on browser fingerprinting to inform users about its use and its dangers. This year, we kicked things up a notch by planning a full week of events related to all questions on privacy, tracking and liberties. Everybody is invited and no technical knowledge is required to follow the presentations.
You can find more information for this special week [HERE](https://biblio.insa-rennes.fr/crypto) along with the [complete workshop schedule](https://biblio.insa-rennes.fr/crypto/ateliers/).
